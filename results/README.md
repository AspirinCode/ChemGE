This folder includes log files of our experiment.

- `log-J-(mu)-(lambda)-seed`: The raw data of Table 1 in the paper.
- `log-rdock-population`: The log of docking experiment at each population.
- `log-rdock-qsub-(# of instances)`: The log of docking experiment with qsub.
- `log-rdock-score-evaluation.csv`: The original data of `ChemGE` on Fig. 6 (b).
